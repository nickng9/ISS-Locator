# ISS-Locator

This quick project was a way for me to practice using APIs as well as Python and specifically the Jupyter Notebook software. It allowed me to work more with data visualization while tackling the general topic of space, two areas that genuinely fascinate me.

All in all, it was a good learning experience and I hope you find it interesting too. The notebook is runnable with completed documentation.
